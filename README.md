Time Series Clustering using R

This repo is just an example repo to learn how to cluster time series data. 

To deal with time series data, we have to consider and choose which is method that good to for. 

In this repository, we use DTW (Dynamic Time Wrapping) instead euclidian to calculate the distance between one signals to another. For the cluster method we use hierarchial clustering and DBSCAN. 

The data that we use is Synthetic Control Chart Time Series from UCI, more details you can visit [this link](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/synthetic_control/synthetic_control.data.html)
